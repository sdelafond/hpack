        This module contains a pure-Python HTTP/2 header encoding (HPACK) logic for use
        in Python programs that implement HTTP/2. It also contains a compatibility
        layer that automatically enables the use of ``nghttp2`` if it's available.

        Release History
        ===============
        
        2.0.1 (2015-11-09)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed a bug where the Python HPACK implementation would only emit header
          table size changes for the total change between one header block and another,
          rather than for the entire sequence of changes.
        
        2.0.0 (2015-10-12)
        ------------------
        
        - Remove unused ``HPACKEncodingError``.
        - Add the shortcut ability to import the public API (``Encoder``, ``Decoder``,
          ``HPACKError``, ``HPACKDecodingError``) directly, rather than from
          ``hpack.hpack``.
        
        1.1.0 (2015-07-07)
        ------------------
        
        - Add support for emitting 'never indexed' header fields, by using an optional
          third element in the header tuple. With thanks to @jimcarreer!
        
        1.0.1 (2015-04-19)
        ------------------
        
        - Header fields that have names matching header table entries are now added to
          the header table. This improves compression efficiency at the cost of
          slightly more table operations. With thanks to `Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa`_.
